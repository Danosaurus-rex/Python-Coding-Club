# Python Coding Club

This repository hosts some introductory notebooks into how to code in Python. These notebooks are aimed at utilising python primarily for **scientific data analysis** and are **targeted at people with little to no experience in programming**. If you are **completely new** to Python or Jupyter notebooks, I suggest reading through **Part 1** as a **.pdf** file (also uploaded to the repo).

The Coding Club consists of ~8 parts (~7 at the present) covering the following:

- Part 1: Introduction and Installation
- Part 2: Data types, keywords and statements
- Part 3: Containers and loops
- Part 4: Functions
- Part 5: Classes
- Part 6: External libraries and modules
- Part 7: Scientific packge overview (I) numpy and matplotlib, (II) pandas and scipy
- ... 
- ...

There could be scope to further explaining other packages such as OpenCV, scikit-learn or other image analysis libraries in the future.

Some of the above sections have exercises to test your understanding, however I strongly reccommend changing the code in the cells in the notebooks (once you have cloned the repository) and seeing the outcome yourself.

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or queries you may have and happy coding!
